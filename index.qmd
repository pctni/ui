<!-- # Introduction

Evidence on cycling potential at the network can inform more cost-effective investment and help ensure that the schemes offering most 'boom for buck' are prioritised in planned pipelines of work.
The proposal is to develop a Propensity to Cycle Tool for Northern Ireland (PCTNI) to help achieve these aims.
The work can move quickly because all input datasets for a 'fastrack' version of the tool are available and the team has experience in developing similar tools for other parts of the UK and Ireland.
An early prototype of the results has already been developed to demonstrate the approach.

## Existing Tools and Resources

-   The PCT for England and Wales: [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/)
    -   Main tool for strategic network planning
    -   Large multi-year DfT funded project
    -   Built foundations that led to more cost-efficient projects
-   The CRUSE tool for Republic of Ireland: [www.cruse.bike](https://www.cruse.bike/)
    -   Deployed across all of Ireland
    -   Added functionality for multiple trip purposes
    -   Uses origin-destination data with 'odjitter' software
    -   Provides estimates of current and potential future cycling levels
-   The NPT for Scotland: [www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot/)
    -   Web application for strategic cycle network planning
    -   Original "fast track" version delivered within 3 months
    -   Based on commuting data -->
